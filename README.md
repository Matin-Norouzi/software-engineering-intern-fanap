#  Software Engineering Internship Challenge – Fanap

This repository contains my solutions for the **Software Engineering Internship Challenge** by **Fanap**.  
The challenge aims to evaluate essential algorithmic problem-solving skills, Python proficiency, and familiarity with basic data analysis and version control practices.

## 🧪 Part 1: Mandatory Programming Questions

### ✔️ Tasks Overview:
1. **Reverse String**  
   Input: `"hello"` → Output: `"olleh"`

2. **Most Frequent Number**  
   Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` → Output: `3`

3. **Prime Number Check**  
   Input: `7` → Output: `True`

4. **Matrix Diagonal Sum**  
   Input: `[[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]]` → Output: `15`

5. **Sort Words in a Sentence**  
   Input: `"machine learning is fun"` → Output: `"fun is learning machine"`

### 🔁 Dual Implementations:
The same five problems have been solved in two separate folders:
- `FILE1`: Primary implementation
- `FILE2`: Alternative implementations or additional attempts

This structure reflects consistency, multiple approaches, and practice.
