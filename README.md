This repository includes my solutions to the **Software Engineering Internship Challenge** provided by **Fanap**.  
The challenge is designed to evaluate fundamental programming skills, problem-solving ability, and optionally, basic data analysis and Git usage.

## 🧪 Part 1 – Required Programming Questions

Each problem is implemented in a separate Python file inside the `part1` folder.  
All solutions are written in a simple and readable way, with basic comments.

### ✔️ Questions:
1. **Reverse a string** → `"hello"` → `"olleh"`
2. **Find the most frequent number in a list** → `[1,2,2,3,3,3]` → `3`
3. **Check if a number is prime**
4. **Sum of the main diagonal of a square matrix**
5. **Sort words in a sentence alphabetically** → `"machine learning is fun"` → `"fun is learning machine"`

## ➕ Part 2 – Optional Challenge

The optional task involves working with a CSV file to analyze fictional sales data.

### 🧾 `sales_analysis.py`:
- Reads a file named `sales.csv`
- Calculates:
  - Total sales amount
  - Average sales amount
  - Highest single-day sale

> The goal was to keep everything simple, without using external libraries like pandas.
